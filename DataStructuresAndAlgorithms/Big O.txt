Big O is a way comparing the two set of code, how efficient they run, time complexity (which code is faster) measurement is in number of operations time/space(memory) complexity.
Time complexity is not measured in time, it is measured in number of operations to complete something.
Regarding space complexity we measure how memory code takes while it runs.
In some cases space efficiency is priority in other time complexity can be priority.
